# Digital Twin Implementation Planning

## User Input

```
/sp.plan

1. Use the existing Docusaurus project and configure folders for Module 2, setting up sidebar navigation and documentation structure for Digital Twin content.
2. Create Module 2 documentation with three Markdown (.md) chapters covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity high-fidelity rendering, and sensor/environment integration for humanoid robots.
```

## Response Summary

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Twin module including:
- Implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context, architecture overview, and phased approach
- Research document (research.md) with technical decisions and alternatives
- Data model (data-model.md) defining content entities and relationships
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) for getting started with the module

The plan covers setting up the Docusaurus project structure, creating three chapters for Gazebo physics simulation, Unity rendering, and sensor integration, and configuring proper navigation.

## Outcome

Implementation plan completed with all required artifacts. Ready for the tasks phase to execute the actual documentation creation.
