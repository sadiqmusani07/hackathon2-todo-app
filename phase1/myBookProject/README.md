# ROS 2 Nervous System for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This Docusaurus project contains educational content about connecting AI decision-making systems to humanoid robot bodies using ROS 2.

## Overview

This module teaches how to establish ROS 2 as the foundational communication and control layer that connects AI decision-making systems to humanoid robot bodies in simulation and real-world environments.

## Chapters

The content is organized into three main chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Core Concepts** - Learn about nodes, topics, services, and the DDS-based architecture
2. **Python AI Agents with rclpy** - Connect AI agents to robotic systems using Python
3. **Humanoid Modeling with URDF** - Define robot bodies using URDF for humanoid robotics

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Basic understanding of Python and AI concepts
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Development
