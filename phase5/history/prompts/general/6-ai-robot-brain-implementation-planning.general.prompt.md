# AI-Robot Brain Implementation Planning

## User Input

```
/sp.plan

1. Extend the existing Docusaurus project to add Module 3 folder and sidebar configuration for the AI-Robot Brain content.
2. Create Module 3 documentation with three Markdown (.md) chapters covering NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS perception and navigation, and Nav2 path planning, with diagrams and examples.
```

## Response Summary

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the AI-Robot Brain module including:
- Implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context, architecture overview, and phased approach
- Research document (research.md) with technical decisions and alternatives
- Data model (data-model.md) defining content entities and relationships
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) for getting started with the module

The plan covers extending the Docusaurus project structure, creating three chapters for Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS perception/navigation, and Nav2 path planning, and configuring proper navigation.

## Outcome

Implementation plan completed with all required artifacts. Ready for the tasks phase to execute the actual documentation creation.
