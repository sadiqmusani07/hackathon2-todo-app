# Glossary of Terms

This glossary contains key terms and definitions used throughout the ROS 2 Nervous System for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.

## A

**Action**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks with feedback and goal management.

**AI Agent**: A software entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve goals, often implemented using machine learning or rule-based systems.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: The underlying middleware used by ROS 2 for communication, providing Quality of Service policies and real-time data distribution.

**Debugging**: The process of identifying, analyzing, and removing errors from computer hardware or software.

## F

**Fixed Joint**: A joint type in URDF that rigidly connects two links with no relative motion.

## I

**Inertial Properties**: Physical properties of a link including mass, center of mass, and inertia tensor used for dynamics simulation.

## J

**Joint**: A connection between two links that defines how they can move relative to each other in a robot.

## L

**Link**: A rigid body in a robot model that can have visual, collision, and inertial properties.

## M

**Middleware**: Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications beyond what's offered by the operating system.

## N

**Node**: An executable process that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes, forming the basic computational element in ROS.

## P

**Prismatic Joint**: A joint type that allows linear sliding movement between two links.

**Publish/Subscribe**: A communication pattern where publishers send messages to topics and subscribers receive messages from topics.

## R

**Revolute Joint**: A joint type that allows rotational movement around a single axis with limited range of motion.

**Robot Operating System (ROS)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

**ROS 2**: The second generation of the Robot Operating System with improved features for real-world applications.

## S

**Service**: A request/response communication pattern in ROS where one node sends a request to another and waits for a response.

## T

**TF (Transform)**: The component of ROS that keeps track of coordinate frames in a tree structure relative to each other over time.

**Topic**: A named bus over which nodes exchange messages in a publish/subscribe communication pattern.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing robot models, including links, joints, and their properties.

## V

**Velocity Controller**: A type of controller that commands joint velocities.

## W

**Workspace**: The space in which a robot can operate, often used in motion planning contexts.
